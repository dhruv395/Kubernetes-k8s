Why do we need?
- For data persistance through out pod lifecycle.
- for data persistance beyond pod lifecycle.
- To share  files between containers inside pod

Volumes
- volumes are associated with lifecycle of pod.

Volume Categories
- Ephemeral(same lifetime as pod) and 
- Durable(Beyond pod lifetime)

Volume Types:

Hostbased volumes:
-emptyDir: 
    . it's created when a pod is assigned to  a node
    . stays as log as pod is running
    . once pod is removed from a node emptydir is deleted forever
    . used for tepmorary space

-hostPath 
    . mounts a file or directory from the host nodes filesystem into your pod
    . remains even after the pod is terminated
    . similar to docker volume
    
cloudbased volumes:
- gcePersistentDisk
- awsEBS
- azureFile

Network based volumes:
- nfs
- iscsi
