When you deploy Kubernetes, you get a cluster
A cluster is a set of machines, called nodes
A cluster has at least one worker node and at least one master node

In earlier days of Kubernetes, worker nodes were called minions
In Kubernetes, every cluster has at least one master node and at least one worker node
There can be more than one master nodes in a cluster to provide a cluster with failover and high availability
There can be multiple clusters in Kubernetes architecture

The worker node(s) host the pods that are the components of the application
The master node(s) manages the worker nodes and the pods in the cluster

In a Cluster Kubernetes supports:
 No more than 5000 nodes
 No more than 150000 total pods
 No more than 300000 total containers
 No more than 100 pods per node
