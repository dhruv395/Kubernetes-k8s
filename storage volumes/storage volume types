Why do we need?
- For data persistance through out pod lifecycle.
- for data persistance beyond pod lifecycle.
- To share  files between containers inside pod

Volumes
- volumes are associated with lifecycle of pod.

Volume Categories
- Ephemeral(same lifetime as pod) and 
- Durable(Beyond pod lifetime)

Volume Types:

Hostbased volumes:
-emptyDir: 
    . it's created when a pod is assigned to  a node
    . stays as log as pod is running
    . once pod is removed from a node emptydir is deleted forever
    . used for tepmorary space

-hostPath 
    . mounts a file or directory from the host nodes filesystem into your pod
    . remains even after the pod is terminated
    . similar to docker volume
    
cloudbased volumes:
- gcePersistentDisk
    . mounts a GCE PD(persistent disk) into a pod
    . volume data is persistent even after pod is terminated
    . Read-write only on one node and read only on many nodes
    Restrictions:
    . You must create a PD using Gcloud or the GCE api or console before you can use it.
    . nodes on which pods are running must be GCE VMs
    . VMs need to be in same GCE project and zone as the PD
